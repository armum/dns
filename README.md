## About
This is a public DNS service for privacy and protection.

An easy and effective way to protect you from many types of:
```
adware
spyware
malware
fakenews
```

It also has a nice side effect of speeding most of your internet browsing, showing cleaner sites and reducing bandwidth usage.

However, it also breaks some advertising links (Google paid results) and I recommend using alternate sites/services, like [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/).

There are several ways to create your local DNS blocker, but it needs time, configuration, maintenance and local devices are more succeptible to all kinds of service interruptions. So even if you have one, you may find this convenient for other devices or as a backup.

That's why I created a public service so that anyone can easily use it with any device (router/computer/smartphone).

Checkout the following guides if you would like to create your own [server](https://github.com/armum/dns/blob/master/server.md) or [local](https://github.com/armum/dns/blob/master/local.md) service. You can also install some packaged services with admin or statistics if you prefer something fancy, like PiHole, that under the hood relies on the same stuff, but you can personalize it.
