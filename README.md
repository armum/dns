## Armum
A public DNS service for privacy.

An easy and effective way to protect you from many types of spyware, block most advertising, certain pop-up traps, prevent user tracking and reduce bandwidth usage.

## About
After using the [hosts file](https://someonewhocares.org/hosts/zero/hosts) for a while, I created a public service so that anyone can easily use it with any device (router/computer/smartphone).

## DNS servers

||__America__|__Europe__|
|-|:-----------:|:----------:|
|__IPv4__|__`45.33.13.111`__|__`172.105.77.127`__|
|__IPv6__|__`2600:3c00::f03c:91ff:fe1f:f74c`__|__`2a01:7e01::f03c:92ff:fe42:70c5`__|

`dns.armum.net` points to _both_ servers.

It would be possible to setup additional DNS servers in specific regions with recurrent donations.

Checkout the following guides if you would like to create your own [server](https://github.com/armum/dns/blob/master/server.md) or [local](https://github.com/armum/dns/blob/master/local.md) service.
