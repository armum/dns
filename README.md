## Armum DNS
A public DNS service for privacy and protection.

An easy and effective way to protect you from many types of:
```
adware
spyware
malware
fake news
gambling
tracking
pop-ups
porn
```

It also has a nice side effect of speeding most of your internet browsing, showing cleaner sites and reducing bandwidth usage.
However, it also breaks some advertising links (Google paid results for example) and I recommend using alternate sites/services, like [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/).

## About
There are several ways to create your local DNS blocker, but it needs time, configuration, maintenance and local devices are more succeptible to all kinds of service interruptions.
That's why I created a public service so that anyone can easily use it with any device (router/computer/smartphone) using an unified [hosts list](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts).

## DNS servers
