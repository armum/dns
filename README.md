Public DNS service that blocks ads, trackers, spyware, hijack, malware, phishing and more.

## About
After using the [hosts file](https://someonewhocares.org/hosts/zero/hosts) for a while in several computers, I decided to create a public service with it so that anyone can easily use it with any router/computer/smartphone.

## Current DNS servers

||**America**|**Europe**|
||-----------|----------|
|IPv4|`45.33.13.111`|`172.105.77.127`|
|IPv6|`2600:3c00::f03c:91ff:fe1f:f74c`|`2a01:7e01::f03c:92ff:fe42:70c5`|

## Contribute

Special thanks to [Dan Pollock](https://someonewhocares.org/) for the maintenance of the hosts file.

Any donation to cover the servers costs is appreciated [Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/mencargo/USD)

It would be possible to setup additional DNS servers in specific regions with recurrent donations.

If you would like to create your own server checkout `server.md`, for a local service see `local.md`.
