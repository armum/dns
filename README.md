Public DNS service that blocks ads, trackers, spyware, hijack, malware, phishing and more.

## About
After using the [hosts file](https://someonewhocares.org/hosts/zero/hosts) for a while, I created a public service so that anyone can easily use it with any router/computer/smartphone.

## DNS servers

## Contribute

Special thanks to [Dan Pollock](https://someonewhocares.org/) for the maintenance of the hosts file.

Any donation to cover the servers costs is appreciated [Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/mencargo/USD)

It would be possible to setup additional DNS servers in specific regions with recurrent donations.

If you would like to create your own server checkout `server.md`, for a local service see `local.md`.
